## Abstract
    Now more than ever, climate change is a very hotly debated topic which often comes up in the news. This year alone, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and World Meteorological Organization released very alarming reports stating that we are "way behind" on the objectives of the Paris Agreement. While there will be some individual action involved if we are to tackle the climate crisis, laws and regulations passed by governments will be imperative to avoid the worst case scenario. Using the Quotebank dataset, we were interested to see whether climate change is used as a campaign promise by politicians or if it really is a subject that is constantly talked about. Furthermore, which political groups are the most involved in proposing solutions and spreading awareness about the pressing climate crisis that we are facing. More importantly: do they Act?
